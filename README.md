# Deep-Learning_Stock-Monthly-Predictions

This project consisted in predicting stock monthly returns using ANN, LSTM and GRU. 
Indeed the idea was to predict the next month performance of the stocks using current month's data.
An index was then constructed based on these predictions and a comparison 
was made between each Neural Network to determine which one was the best in predicting stock monthly returns. 

- Vanilla_ANN.py, LSTM.py, GRU.py contain the code for the data preparation, training and testing of the respective neural networks

- Models_Perf_Index_Construction.py contains the code where you can find the indexes being constructed and their respective performance 

- Stocks_names.csv and Macroeconomic_factors.csv contain respectively the names of the stocks in the universe and the macroeconomic factors used in the project

- You can get the excel file data.xlsx for all the stocks here : https://www.dropbox.com/s/gymnv5xpnv5v42m/data.xlsx?dl=0

Have fun !
